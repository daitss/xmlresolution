These tests can depend on a resolving proxy being set, for the following hosts:

	roemo-foxtrot
	*.sacred.net
	*.fcla.net

In particular, on my laptop romeo-foxtrot, squid can get confused as
it switches networks. If there are odd failures, restart squid, or
adjust the spec tests (look for 'def proxy') or set the RESOLVER_PROXY
environment variable to point to a different HTTP proxy.
