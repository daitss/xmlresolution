This directory is a fallback for data files maintained by the XML
Resolution service.  You almost certainly want to put them somewhere
else so your data is maintained across upgrades.  The two required
subdirectories, 'schemas' and 'collections', must be writable by the
server. The data files in the 'collections' subdirectory are
automatically deleted when old enough.
